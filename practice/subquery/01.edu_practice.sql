-- 서브 쿼리 관한 연습 문제
-- 문제 1 : 성공!
-- 선생님 설명
SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM employees 
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

-- 최종 내가 풀은 답안
SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM employees 
WHERE salary < (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);


-- 문제 2. 다시 풀기! (사용할 서브쿼리) 
SELECT AVG(salary) avgSalary,
                        MAX(salary) maxSalary
                    FROM employees;
-- 정답
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.salary, 
    t.avgSalary, t.maxSalary
FROM employees e, ( SELECT AVG(salary) avgSalary,
                        MAX(salary) maxSalary

WHERE e.salary BETWEEN t.avgSalary AND t.maxSalary
ORDER BY salary;

SELECT employee_id, first_name, salary, department_id From employees 
WHERE (department_id, salary) IN ( SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) 
FROM employees GROUP BY department_id) ORDER BY salary DESC;
